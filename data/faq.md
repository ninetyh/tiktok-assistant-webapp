# How it works?

There is no magic, just some code!

Let's say the bot you're using is a chrome extension, then it's just a lightweight app made up of some HTML, Javascript and CSS.

When you **Run comment task**, the app will send a series of HTTP requests to the TikTok server, with some delay between each request to avoid overwhelming TikTok server.

In fact, when you manually comment to video, the underlying HTTP request is exactly the same as the one made by a Rebotou Bot. The only difference is that manually send 100 comments requires you to click the button 100 times, whereas using a bot requires only 1 or even 0 click.

For repetitive tasks, humans will never beat bots.

# Will my account get banned using Rebotou?

No, as long as you don't abuse it.

Everything Rebotou can do, you can also do it by yourself, manually (well, if you're willing to spend lots of time doing repetitive work). What Rebotou can do is not beyond the capability that TikTok provides to its users. You can spend hours manually following users, liking items, or sending messages to your followers… Will TikTok ban your account because of that? Of course not! So why would you think a Chrome Extension that spends the same amount of time doing the same things would get your account banned?

Rebotou does make a lot of repetitive tasks easier with a simple click, and because of this, you need to be more careful about how you use this capability. For example, using Rebotou, you can easily send messages to thousands of users, you do have to be more careful when doing this to make sure that the messages are friendly and useful to other users. **Never ever spam other TikTok users!** On the other hand, if you mass spam other users, even if you manually send the message one by one, TikTok will ban your account.

I believe the above explanation will help you understand that it is never the tool itself, but how you use the tool, that keeps your account safe or gets it banned. Using the tool in a good way will help you make more money and be successful, while abusing it will get you nowhere and even get your account banned.
