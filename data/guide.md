# 1. Never Abuse Rebotou

Rule number one, NEVER ABUSE REBOTOU!

Never send mass comments to spam other TikTok users! Don't auto-comment too fast or too frequently. Don't use the Rebotou Bot too aggressively. Stay low key and get rich!

If you didn't install it yet and would like to, just head over to this [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rebotou-growth-hacking-bo/cfgkjnjmlckppgajnicogfdnhhndpikk), hit the **Add to Chrome** (Chrome is the name of your browser, if you use another browser it may be another name, e.g. Brave, Edge) button and you are all set.
